               <p>My name is Jason Meli. I am currently a student in the Coding Bootcamp program at the University of
                Richmond. I decided to enroll in the program to make a career change to give myself and my five-year-old
                daughtar a better life. If you've ever done landscaping before, you will understand why I've decided to
                make a career change</p>
                
                
                <p>A few facts about me. I was born in Buffalo, New York. That makes me a Bills fan. I'm a Sabres fan, too, but I don't like hockey that much. I only watch it if the Sabres are in the playoffs, which rarely happens. I also enjoy soccer. I
                    like to fish, though I don't do it as much as I'd like. I also enjoy reading, though I don't do it as
                    much as I should. I am also a mediocre guitar player. Besides my daughter, I have 15 nieces and nephews. My lucky number is 7 because I was born on the 17th at 7:30 and weighed 7 pounds 7 ounces.</p>

               <p>So I need some more filler in here to beef up this bio. So here's some random facts about me. I haven't had a speeding ticket in 20 years. My favorite band is Led Zeppelin. I was born on the 17th at 7:30, weighing 7 lbs. 7 ozs. My favorite color is blue. And we all know that Ms. Lippy's car is green and Billy likes to drink soda. Bonus points if you get that reference.</p>
